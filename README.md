  <p>This project implements WorldWise, a React single-page application (SPA) designed to be your travel companion. Track your adventures by creating a list of visited cities, visualizing them on a map (planned feature), and adding details like countries and emojis (planned feature).</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>City Management: Add, view, and manage your list of visited cities.</li>
    <li>Interactive Map (Planned): Integrate a third-party map library to visualize your city list.</li>
    <li>User Authentication (Basic): Log in to manage your travel data (account management features planned).</li>
    <li>Context API: Leverage React's Context API for efficient state management across components (city data, authentication state).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

  <pre>
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router DOM: Routing library for single-page application navigation.
Fake Auth Context (Placeholder): Placeholder for a future real authentication system.
Cities Context: Manages city data and provides methods to child components.
  </pre>
