# Project - World-Wise

Hello,

This is my practice project on ReactJS, which I developed while taking "The Ultimate React Course 2024" by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project, featured in one of the course modules, has been the most enjoyable one I've worked on. Jonas provided a starter file and guided me through implementing key features like React Router and Context API, as well as navigating between routes using URL propagation. It was an amazing learning experience for me.

You can check out the live project and access the repository through the following links.
